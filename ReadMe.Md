# Java Swing Applications

This repository contains Java Swing applications for different purposes. Each application is designed as a standalone graphical user interface (GUI) using the Swing framework.

## Applications

1. **Image Recognition App (`imagedis`):**
    - Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV and displays the video feed with highlighted face rectangles.

2. **Login App (`LoginWindow`):**
    - A simple login window with username and password fields. After successful login, it opens the Image Recognition App.

3. **Registration Form App (`regis`):**
    - A registration form that collects user information such as name, email, password, gender, country, hobbies, and feedback.

4. **Main Application (`medium`):**
    - Acts as the main menu, providing options to open the Timeline App, Image Recognition App, and Registration Form App.

5. **Timeline App (`timeline`):**
    - Calculates and displays the user's age in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds based on the entered date of birth.

## Instructions for Running

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure you have Java installed on your system.

2. **OpenCV Setup:**
    - For the Image Recognition App (`imagedis`), ensure OpenCV is properly configured and the necessary XML files are available.

3. **Compilation and Execution:**
    - Compile each Java file using `javac filename.java`.
    - Run the compiled file using `java filename`.

## Usage

1. **Login App (`LoginWindow`):**
    - Enter the predefined username (`123`) and password (`123`) to log in.

2. **Registration Form App (`regis`):**
    - Fill in the registration form and click the "Submit" button to see the registration details.

3. **Main Application (`medium`):**
    - Provides options to open different applications.

4. **Timeline App (`timeline`):**
    - Enter the date of birth in the format 'dd-MM-yyyy' and click the "Submit" button to see the calculated age.
